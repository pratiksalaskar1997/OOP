# OOP

Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming.
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. 
The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can 
access this data except that function.

Class: The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. 
It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, 
which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.

Encapsulation: In normal terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. 
In Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.

Abstraction: Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++.
Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. 
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details 
or implementation.

Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of 
a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. 
Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class.
Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class.
